## Before You Start
You will need an OpenAI API key to use DALLE-3. Once you've obtained your key, enter it in the `apikey` field in the notebook. Run all the cells, picking the appropriate parameters and number of generations you desire. If you choose to mount your Google Drive, images will be saved in a folder called `DALLE-3 output` along with a text file that contains the prompt.
